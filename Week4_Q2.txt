*Introduction / Business Problem*

"Which locality of all the cities in United States would be the best place to start a Gaming Arcade?"

My boss Anthony is interested in starting a gaming arcade in the best locality of all the cities in United states. He defines a best locatlity based on the following constraints,

1.) Population density of a locality
2.) Per Capital income
3.) Population of each location
4.) Venues in each locality

The category of the venues that he's interested in are,

1.) Arts and Entertainment
2.) Shops & Service
3.) College and University
4.) Event
5.) Food
6.) Nightife Spot
7.) Outdoors & Recreation
8.) Professional & Other places
9.) Residence
10.) Travel & Transport
11.) Data

To help Anthony set up a gaming arcade, we will get the data from the below sources

List of all the cities in United States with population density and coordinates: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population
List of all the cities in United States with Per Capita Income : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_counties_by_per_capita_income

Using Four Square API to get the following

List of all venues in each city
List of all venues in each locality in the selected city
Using the above data we will first select best city to proceed with based on the values like Population density, per capita income of the state, number of venues (as we are giving weights to each venue based on its category).

Once we select a city, we then go hunting for Localities. Again, we do it using the same approach i.e. based on the scores of venues in each locality.
